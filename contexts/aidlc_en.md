# AI Development Life Cycle (AIDLC)
**A New Development Lifecycle Theory for the AI Agent Era**

## AIDLC Organizational Structure

### Organic 3-Layer Architecture
```
Cluster (Collection of Multiple Cells)
├── Cell A (Development Team - Organic Collaborative Entity)
│   ├── Unit 1 (Responsible Group - Dynamic Formation)
│   ├── Unit 2 
│   └── Unit 3
└── Cell B
    ├── Unit 4
    └── Unit 5
```

### Definition of Each Layer

**Repository (Development Target)**:
- Independently deployable functional unit
- Clear API boundaries
- Completable by 1-2 people in approximately 3 months

**Unit (Minimum Personnel Unit)**:
- **1-2 people responsible for a specific Repository** (changes through rotation)
- **Single committer system** for complete conflict avoidance
- Development responsibility unit at each point in time

**Cell (Development Team - Organic Collaborative Entity)**:
- **3-4 members** responsible for **2-4 Repositories**
- **Regular Unit formation rotation** (2 days to 1 week)
- Maintain state where **everyone understands all Repositories**
- **Organic collaboration**: Flexible formation changes according to environment

**Cluster (Entire Project)**:
- **Collection of multiple Cells** composing complete product
- API coordination between Cells, integration testing, deployment

### Organic Characteristics of Cells

**Biological Metaphor**:
- **Cell division**: Growth through Repository splitting
- **Intracellular coordination**: Flexible changes in Unit formation
- **Metabolism**: Activation through member rotation
- **Adaptability**: Formation changes according to project phases

**Differences from Traditional Organizations**:
- **Fixed organizational chart** → **Dynamic collaborative entity**
- **Mechanical division of labor** → **Flexible collaboration**
- **Rigid roles** → **Fluid responsibilities**

### Dynamic Unit Formation Strategy

**Basic Policy**: Maximize learning effects and redundancy by changing Unit formations

**Strategic Meaning of 1-2 People**:
- **1 person**: Complete responsibility, maximum efficiency (for experienced members, simple tasks)
- **2 people**: Composed of the following patterns
  - **Expert + Expert**: Complex, important feature development
  - **Expert + Onboarding member**: Learning, research SPEC creation
  - **Expert + Research member**: New technology validation, PoC development
- **Single committer**: Always 1 expert has commit authority, the other provides support and learning

**Benefits of Formation Changes**:
- **Learning effect**: Acquire diverse perspectives and skills through combinations with different people
- **Complete redundancy**: Everyone has collaborative experience with everyone, preventing specific pair dependency
- **Team cohesion**: Improved mutual understanding within Cell

### Cell Sync (Synchronization System)

**Daily Sync (15 minutes)**:
- Share progress and blockers of each Repository/Unit
- Report urgent issues and dependency problems

**Weekly Planning (1 hour)**:
- Plan next Unit formation and rotation
- Coordinate API changes and integration between Repositories
- Check onboarding progress and learning status

**Efficiency**:
- Prior asynchronous information sharing (Slack/documents)
- Time reduction through standardized formats
- Automatic progress report generation by AI agents

## SPEC-Driven Onboarding
New Joiners and New Hires in Units participate in development as sub-members alongside experts.
Through research SPECs and other means, they safely understand the codebase while contributing to development.

**Unit combining onboarding: Expert + Onboarding member (2 people)**
- Expert: Single committer, technical decisions, final implementation
- Onboarding: Research SPEC creation, codebase learning, pair development

**Research SPEC Utilization Flow**:
```
Research member → Create research SPEC → Expert loads into AI agent → Efficient implementation
```

### Organizational Value

- **Balance of learning and productivity**: SPECs created during onboarding process become organizational assets
- **Knowledge asset utilization**: Research process becomes context for AI agents
- **Natural responsibility transfer**: Authority expansion with SPEC quality improvement
- **Quality assurance**: Quality maintenance through final checks by experts. Learners can learn freely in a safe environment

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Unit efficiency**: Complete conflict avoidance (organizational solution)
- **Cell organicity**: Environmental adaptation, flexible collaborative system
- **Cell redundancy**: Elimination of single points of failure (anyone can continue development)
- **Cell quality**: Mutual review system (diverse perspectives)
- **Cluster learning**: Skill improvement and knowledge distribution for everyone
- **Onboarding efficiency**: Balance of learning and productivity through research SPEC → AI agent collaboration

### Disadvantages
- Switching costs (time to understand context between Repositories)
- Cell management overhead (dynamic Unit formation, onboarding management)
- Difficulty in Repository division (judging appropriate granularity)

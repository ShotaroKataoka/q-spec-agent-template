<!-- Steering Vision Template -->

# Vision

## Problem Statement
Describe the specific problem this project solves.

**Example**:
```
When developers create CLI tools, they need to write boilerplate code for 
argument parsing, configuration management, and logging every time, 
preventing them from focusing on the essential logic.
```

**Information to elicit through interview**:
- What problem are you facing?
- How are you currently dealing with it?
- What is unsatisfactory about the current approach?

---

## Target Users
Clarify who this project is for.

**Example**:
```
- Python developers who frequently create CLI tools
- Developers who value simple and maintainable code
- Developers who want to start using it immediately without learning costs
```

**Information to elicit through interview**:
- Who are the primary users?
- What is the users' technical level?
- What do users value most?

---

## Existing Solutions & Gaps
Describe existing solutions and what they lack.

**Example**:
```
- Click/Typer: Feature-rich but high learning cost, excessive for simple tools
- argparse: Standard library but results in verbose and hard-to-read code
- This project achieves "maximum functionality with minimal code"
```

**Information to elicit through interview**:
- Have you tried existing solutions?
- What was unsatisfactory about them?
- How is this project different?

---

## Project Goal
Clearly describe what this project will achieve.

**Example**:
```
Enable creation of production-ready CLI tools with 10 lines of code or less.
Provide an environment where developers can focus on essential logic 
without writing boilerplate code.
```

**Information to elicit through interview**:
- What should the project achieve?
- What is the most important feature?
- Conversely, what will you NOT do?

---

## Success Criteria
Define the state in which the project can be considered successful.

**Example**:
```
- Beginners can create a CLI tool in 5 minutes
- Created tools comply with standard CLI conventions
- Intuitive to use without reading documentation
- Easy to integrate into existing projects
```

**Information to elicit through interview**:
- What would constitute success?
- Are there quantitative metrics?
- What feedback do you expect from users?

---

**⚠️ Important: Record "Universal Truths"**

In this file, record only essential information that will not change regardless of project evolution.

✅ Good examples:
- "This tool operates as a CLI" (essence of the project)
- "Prioritize developer productivity above all" (unchanging value)

❌ Bad examples:
- "Currently has 3 commands" (implementation state, variable information)
- "Implement basic features in Phase 1" (roadmap, variable information)

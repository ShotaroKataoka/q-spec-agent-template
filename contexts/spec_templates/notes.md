# Notes: [Feature Name]

## How to Write Notes
- **Append-only**: Never edit or delete existing content, always add new discoveries at the end
- **Natural language**: Write as if explaining to a colleague, in plain language
- **Capture thought process**: "Initially thought X, but actually it was Y"
- **Be specific**: Include numbers, error messages, commands, and concrete examples
- **Use complete sentences**: "Implemented X" not "X implementation"
